# Fed-Impact-on-Market: How the Federal Reserve Impacts the Market

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between the U.S. Federal Reserve's policies (e.g., Federal Funds Rate) and the performance of the U.S. financial markets, particularly focusing on the S&P 500 Index. The analysis also includes the effects of inflation (CPI), interest rates, and unemployment on market trends.

## Project Goal
The goal is to understand how Federal Reserve monetary policy impacts the stock market and other macroeconomic indicators. The project uses data from Yahoo Finance (S&P 500), FRED (macroeconomic indicators like Fed Funds Rate, CPI, unemployment rate), and other relevant datasets.
