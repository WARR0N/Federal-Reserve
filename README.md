# Federal-Reserve
This capstone project investigates how the Federal Reserve's key policy decisions and economic indicators influence the performance of the U.S. stock market, specifically the S&P 500 index, from 2010 to 2024. By analyzing interest rates, inflation, and other Fed-related data, this project visualizes and quantifies the relationship between monetary policy and market behavior.
